<h5>Resource Roundtable</h5>

<p>This month is going to be a little different.  Rather than have just one or two individuals speak about a single tool, we're going to have a handful of members share about the tools, resources, plugins, extensions, and apps they use on a daily basis to be productive, social, or just plain awesome.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/twofivethreetwo">James Fleeting</a> will introduce us briefly to <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, his <a href="http://monkeecreate.github.com/jquery.simpleWeather/">simpleWeather</a> <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> plugin and maybe a few other things; <a href="https://twitter.com/jslaybaugh">Jorin Slaybaugh</a> will share about <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a>, <a href="http://asana.com">Asana</a>, <a href="http://droplr.com">Droplr</a> and a few of the <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> extensions he can't live without; and <a href="https://twitter.com/ebinnion">Eric Binnion</a> will demo <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms</a> - a <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> plugin.  We plan on having a few others share some as well but we promise there will be time if you have something you want to tell us about or introduce us to.  As always this group is designed to be a forum for open discussions, so don't be afraid to jump in and ask questions or tell us about what you love. Overall, this talk will be less technical and more focused on the tools themselves rather than the code behind the tools.</p>

<p>This will be our last meeting for 2012 as the December meeting falls in the heart of a busy holiday season.  But we are excited to announce we have big plans for 2013, so come and join us this month and find out what we have in store for the next year!</p>
