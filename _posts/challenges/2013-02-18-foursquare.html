Those four rectangles must collectively fill the browser window regardless of the size of the browser window. For an example, please view <a href="/images/challenge-foursquare.png" target="_blank">this image</a>. Colors are up to you.</p>

<p class="attn"><u>BONUS</u> <br/>An extra entry will be awarded for an entry which not only meets the criteria but also adjusts when the browser is resized.</p>
