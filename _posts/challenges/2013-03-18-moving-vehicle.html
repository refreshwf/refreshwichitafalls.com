<p>Create a vehicle (car, truck, bicycle, spaceship, be creative) completely out of CSS and HTML and then with the click of a button (or any element), make it move across and out of the window! It can move in any direction but it must start stationary, and move completely out of view. <span class="attn">Because this is a little more advanced, all entries who complete the task will be automatically awarded TWO entries! </span></p>

<p class="attn"><u>BONUS</u> <br/>An extra entry will be awarded for an entry which not only meets the criteria but also does at least one thing extra. Perhaps your car has headlights or the wheels spin. Perhaps your spaceship is driven by an alien. :-)</p>

<p class="attn"><u>BONUS</u> <br/>An extra entry will be awarded for an entry which meets the criteria solely with HTML+CSS and uses NO JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>Got the answer? Create a <a href="http://codepen.io" title="CodePen">CodePen</a> or a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">JS Fiddle</a> and <a href="mailto:hello@refreshwichitafalls.com?subject=[Challenge]">E-mail</a> the answer</strong>.<br />All answers are due by the next meeting and must be done in JavaScript + HTML + CSS.</p>
