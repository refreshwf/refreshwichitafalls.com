<p>Write a function that transforms a string into title case. This mostly means: capitalizing only every first letter of every word in the string. However, there are some non-obvious exceptions to title case which can't easily be hard-coded. Your function must accept, as a second argument, a set or list of words that should not be capitalized. Furthermore, the first word of every title should always have a capital leter. For example:</p>
{% highlight js %}

// Example #1
exceptions = ['jumps', 'the', 'over']
titlecase('the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', exceptions)

// returns
'The Quick Brown Fox jumps over the Lazy Dog'

// Example #2
exceptions = ['are', 'is', 'in', 'your', 'my']
titlecase('THE vitamins ARE IN my fresh CALIFORNIA raisins', exceptions)

// returns
'The Vitamins are in my Fresh California Raisins'
{% endhighlight %}
