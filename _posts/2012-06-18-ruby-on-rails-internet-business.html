<h5>An introduction to building a Ruby on Rails application.</h5>

<p>Come learn what all the craze is about as <strong>Adam Hernandez</strong> demonstrates the process of creating a Ruby on Rails application from the ground-up. He will discuss the basics to building an application using the model-view-controller paradigm and why it is important to maintain this core design pattern. He will show you how to quickly and easily install valuable time-saving 3rd-party plugins and gems that will assist you in crafting your dream Rails application. And lastly, he will discuss what an object-relational mapper is and how it can be used to retrieve data without having to write a single line of SQL.</p>

<p>Adam Hernandez graduated from Midwestern State University in 2006 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. He is lead software engineer for a shopping cart platform being developed at Digimedia.</p>
