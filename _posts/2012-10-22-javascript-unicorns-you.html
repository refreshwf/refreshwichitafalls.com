<h5>JavaScript, Unicorns, and You!</h5>

<p>Ok, so there's not actually any unicorns. But that's because JavaScript is awesome enough on its own! No, seriously, if you think JavaScript is as useful on a sparkly horn on a pale horse and is only good for alerts and mouseovers then come get re-introduced to the hottest new (17 year old) language in programming. In this talk we'll start by showing you the good, bad, and ugly of JavaScript and functional programming before we spend a little time with jQuery and introduce you to Knockout's MVVM approach to application design. If there's time, we'll even jump into Node.js and show you how JavaScript can even be more powerful on the server than it is on the front end.</p>
