<p>As web developers we have a choice. We can choose to develop static pages, or we can choose to work with content management systems (CMS's). This month <a href="http://twitter.com/ebinnion" target="_blank">Eric Binnion</a> will give us a look into <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. WordPress's power comes from the fact that it has a huge following. There are currently over 59,000,000 websites using WordPress worldwide and there are over 1,600 free theme in the WordPress repositories. </p>

<p>As developers, WordPress has many features that are attractive to us. Eric will cover the basics of WordPress theme and plugin development. You can expect to hear topics such as: ajax, working with settings API, how to use options, creating custom meta boxes, how to use wp-cron, and how to convert a static website into a WordPress theme.</p>
