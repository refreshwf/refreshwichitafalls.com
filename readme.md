This repo is the home of Refresh WF which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com). The starting point for this site was [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

## Contributing a Post or Talk

If you are preparing a talk or working up a blog post then please clone this repo and create your new post in `_drafts/`. There are currently two post templates already there, one for blog and one for talks. Duplicate the one you want to use and make any changes needed along with adding in your content. Commit and push your changes to your cloned repo. Then submit a pull request to us and after looking it over we will merge in your changes and publish your post. Below are some tips for contributing a post.

* Posts are just static HTML so please keep it clean and use proper tags. 
* Although the site supports syntax highlighting we recommend using embed codes from GitHub's gist or jsfiddle (or any other service) to embed code. If you are showing demos then embeding or linking to a jsfiddle is going to work best.
* This site is static and is hosted on GitHub so there is no server side.
